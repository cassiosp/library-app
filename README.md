# library-app

Library app is a library management tool created in a Udemy course I took to update my Java skills with more recent frameworks and methodologies, specially regarding Java EE 7 and some nice additions to Java 8.

This code is far from the quality level I appreciate. Although the course author, Luciano Molinari, holds a deep and concrete knowledge and makes a strong effort to produce good code in this course, time and scope limitations are obvious enemies of perfection. For the same reason, I rarely try to improve the code for this course, as my objective here is to get back in touch with Java technologies after around a year and a half coding almost only in Ruby on Rails.

That said, enjoy your ride and let me know if you have any questions or comments about this little experience.
